Task0:
O(1) Since only 2 lines of code are executed independently of the input size

Task1:
O(2n) Since for loop execution plus adding the data to set gives 2n

Task2:
O(5n) for loop(n) plus if comparison(n) plus cast to int(n) plus 2 assignments (5)

Task3:
- Part A: O(8n+ nlogn) nlogn from python sorted function + 8 operation made for each data in the list
- Part B: O(4n) For loop + 2 if conditions and incrementing counter

Task4:
O(10n + nlogn + 2m)

Where for every task:
n = calls size
m = texts size
