Task0:
O(1) Since only 2 lines of code are executed independently of the input size

Task1:
O(n) Since for loop execution plus adding the data to set gives 3n

Task2:
O(n) for loop(n) + max plus cast to int(n) plus 2 assignments (4n)

Task3:
- Part A: O( nlogn ) nlogn from python sorted function + 8n operation made for each data in the list
- Part B: O(n) For loop + 2 if conditions and incrementing counter (4n)

Task4:
O( nlogn ) Due to sorted function

Where for every task:
n = calls size
m = texts size
