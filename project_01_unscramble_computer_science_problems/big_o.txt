Task0:
O(1) Since only 2 lines of code are executed independently of the input size

Task1:
O(n) Since for loop execution plus adding the data to set gives 3n

Task2:
O(n) for loop(n) + max plus cast to int(n) plus 2 assignments (4n)

Task3:
- Part A: O( nlogn ) nlogn from python sorted function + 8n operation made for each data in the list
- Part B: O(n) For loop + 2 if conditions and incrementing counter (4n)

Task4:
O(n^2) In the case all callers are telemarketers, a nested loop is required to check if the callers
elements are in the other ls^2s DuIn the case all callers are telemarketers, a nested loop is required to check if the callers
elements are in the other lists
