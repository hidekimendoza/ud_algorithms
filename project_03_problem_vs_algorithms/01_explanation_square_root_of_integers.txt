On this case to calculate the square root, I decided to iterate starting from
zero until i get a number m=n+1 where m^2 > input.

Example table:
Input    Result    Iterations
0        0         1
1        1         2
2        1         2
3        1         2
4        2         3
5        2         3
6        2         3
7        2         3
8        2         3
9        3         4


Where Time complexity is equal to O(log(n) + 1)  = O(log(n))
For space complexity, due to the use of a recursive function, stack consumption
is O(log(n)).
