Space complexity O(n), where n is the number of nodes at the tree (stored words)
This apply for all cases

Time Complexity
In order to find the prefix, since we are using nested hash tables, we need one
iteration per character in the word to find O(w) where w is the length of the
word.

To look up into the suffixes, the same time complexity O(mn) where n are the
total number of nodes that a certain prefix contains and m is the number of
words with that suffix.
