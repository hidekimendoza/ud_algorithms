To solve this problem with time complexity of O(n), the approach used was
to iterate once through the whole array starting from first element
and compare them with two variables containing last found min and max values


Time Complexity O(n) - Single traversal lookup
Space Complexity O(1) Since only two variables are created (min and max) during
the execution
