Space complexity O(n), where n is the number of nodes at the tree (stored words)
This apply for all cases

Time Complexity
In order to find the path, since we are using nested hash tables, we need one
iteration we need to iterate per sub path split by '/' character and the
time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of sub paths

To look up into the suffixes, the same time complexity O(n) where n is the
number of sub paths
