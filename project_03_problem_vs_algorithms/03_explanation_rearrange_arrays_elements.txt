On this case, since required marked to have time complexity of O(nlog(n))
I decided to use a heapsort for sorting, (logn for heapify * n to create
the heap, then with the sorted data, then iterate per element on the list
to generate the two numbers

Time complexity O(nlog(n)) -> nlog(n) heapsort + n generate numbers
Space Complexity O(n): On Stack due to heapify action
