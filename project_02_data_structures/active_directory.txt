Time complexity O(n) : Due to need to do the search for every group
until it finds the user of if it doesn't find it,
(worst case if user is in the deepest group)

Space complexity O(n): Since recursion call is executed based on the number
of subdirectories (call function = stack push)

I decided to use recursion here in order to repeat the same search at each
group/subgroup by using a set, to avoid infinite recursion
