Time complexity O(n) : Due to need to do the search for every group
until it finds the user of if it doesn't find it,
(worst case if user is in the deepest group)

Space complexity O(1) No data stored, only printed

I decided to use recursion here in order to repeat the same search at each
group/subgroup by using a set, to avoid infinite recursion
