Time complexity:
  - Encoding O(log(n)) -> O(n)[get different characters and counts]
                          * log(n)[generate codes-binary tree search]
                          * log(n) PriorityQueue insert
  - Decoding  O(log(n)) -> nlog(n) search each character at the tree

Use of python PriorityQueue data type to be able to has nodes sorted
at the queue. Those nodes simulates binary three nodes to give availability
of searching generating binary code
