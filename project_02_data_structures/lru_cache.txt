Complexity:
Time - As required All operations takes O(1) time.
Space - O(n) -> I could consider it O(n) where n is the size of the linked list,
                + O(1) Variables created at the functions (set and get)
                are independent of the size


Used map to enable O(1) search and Double referenced linked list to
enable set and make cache hits with O(1)
