Time complexity:
    union -> O(n) -> Need to iterate over both lists to get the values

    intersection -> O(n) -> Need to iterate over both lists to get the value

Space complexity:
    union -> O(n) -> Since creation of new linked list is used
                    + set O(2n)

    intersection -> O(n) -> Since creation of new linked list is used
                    + 2 sets O(3n), one for intersections and other for
                    elements of one of the lists

Linked lists were required for this project
