Time complexity:
 - append O(1) Since only need to add one data
 - lookup O(n) If first added is the one is required

Space complexity O(1): For each character added to the chain

 - append O(n) The size of the blockchain is equivalent to the number of blocks
 added
 - lookup O(1) No need to create other linked list, just iterate over the
 current one

On this project linked list has used, but instead of pointing head to next
node, the linking between nodes is reversed (pointing to previous node)
